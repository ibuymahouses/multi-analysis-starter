## Test Pages (Not Branched)

The following test pages remain on the main branch as they are for development/testing purposes:

- `test-ag-grid.tsx` - AG Grid testing
- `test-excel-table.tsx` - Excel-style table testing
- `test-simple.tsx` - Simple component testing
- `test-table.tsx` - Table component testing

## Branch Workflow

### Starting Work on a Feature
```bash
# Switch to the appropriate feature branch
git checkout feature/property-listings

# Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add advanced property filtering"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/property-listings
```

### Merging Features Back to Main
```bash
# Switch to main and update
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature/property-listings

# Push to GitHub
git push origin master

# Clean up - delete the feature branch
git branch -d feature/property-listings
git push origin --delete feature/property-listings
```

### Creating New Feature Branches
```bash
# For new features, create from main
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# Work on your feature
# ... make changes ...

# Push the new branch
git push -u origin feature/new-feature-name
```

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Focused Development**: Each branch focuses on a specific feature
2. **Easier Testing**: Test individual features in isolation
3. **Better Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different features
4. **Cleaner History**: Git history is organized by feature
5. **Easier Rollbacks**: Can revert specific features without affecting others
6. **Parallel Development**: Work on multiple features simultaneously

## Future Feature Branches

As the application grows, consider creating these additional feature branches:

- `feature/user-dashboard` - User dashboard and preferences
- `feature/admin-panel` - Administrative tools and user management
- `feature/data-import` - Data import and management tools
- `feature/reporting` - Advanced reporting and analytics
- `feature/mobile-responsive` - Mobile optimization
- `feature/performance-optimization` - Performance improvements
- `feature/accessibility` - Accessibility improvements

## Best Practices

1. **Keep branches focused**: One feature per branch
2. **Regular updates**: Periodically merge main into feature branches
3. **Clear commit messages**: Use conventional commit format
4. **Test before merging**: Ensure features work before merging to main
5. **Clean up**: Delete feature branches after merging
6. **Documentation**: Update this document when adding new branches

## Quick Reference

```bash
# List all branches
git branch -a

# Switch to a feature branch
git checkout feature/property-listings

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Push a new branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# Update feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-feature
git merge main
```

This structure provides a solid foundation for scalable, organized development of the Multi-Analysis application.

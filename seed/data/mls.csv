The property is in the ""Central Business District"" zoning area, which is intended to support mixed-use development. Allows up to 10 stories by right, with opportunity for residential units atop ground-level commercial. Especially with close proximity to transit, an investment offers potential for maximum density and income, with a more streamlined approval process.

The property has matured into a high-performing, cash-flowing investment in one of Massachusetts’ most supply-constrained, high-demand rental markets. Future upside remains in aligning rents with market levels and enhancing management efficiencies. Located along Massachusetts Route 28 in Hyannis—Barnstable County’s largest and most dynamic village—the property benefits from regional connectivity, proximity to the Cape Cod Gateway Airport, commercial corridors, and new development.
